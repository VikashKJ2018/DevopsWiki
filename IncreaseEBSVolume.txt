One of the Web Server started with 8 GB of EBS volume but later it need to be increased to 15 GB.

Steps to increase the space:
a. First we need to increase/modify the EBS volume through console. It can be done online, that means no need to stop the
instance.

b. Then we need to connect to the server through SSH, and check the added space through lsblk.

c.  sudo mount -o size=10M,rw,nodev,nosuid -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp. 
This will mount the temporary file system tmpfs to the /tmp mount point. This creates a 10 M tmpfs mounted to /tmp.

d.  sudo growpart /dev/DEVICE_ID PARTITION_NUMBER (make sure there is a space between DEVICE_ID_PARTITION and PARTITION_NUMBER)
e. sudo resize2fs /dev/DEVICE_IDPARTITION_NUMBER
f. sudo umount /tmp
